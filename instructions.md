# Building Instructions

## Casing

The casing is designed for a Lasercutter. Use 5mm MDF, not acrylics, as the casing is plugged and not glued. Therefore you might need some abrasive paper, if your lasercutter focus is really small.

The general idea is to build a shelf-like casing and put the hardware into two drawers, which are connected by a large hole in the middle. This way it is on the one hand possibe to reach each component without disassembling the whole cluser and on the other hand possible to extend the casing by a second one build on top of the first one.
